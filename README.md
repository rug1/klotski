## Klotski

Created using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The blocks are displayed using CSS Grid. The initial position of the blocks are saved in the state and passed down as props to the styled components.

My solution can be found in [`App.js`](https://github.com/rug1/klotski/blob/master/src/App.js) but it is still a work in progress.

### How to run

1. `yarn install`

2. `yarn start`
