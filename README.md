## Klotski

Created using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The blocks are displayed using CSS Grid. The initial position of the blocks are saved in the state and passed down as props to the styled components.

I have not so far managed to complete the solution.

### How to run

1. `yarn install`

2. `yarn start`
